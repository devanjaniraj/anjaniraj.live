# Anjani Raj — Personal Website

🌐 Live at: https://anjaniraj.live

This repository contains the source code for my personal website.

The website represents my identity, principles, and long-term direction.  
It is designed to be clean, modern, fast, and intentional.

## Purpose

This website is not a portfolio or a résumé.

It is a **living personal identity** —  
a place that reflects how I think, what I value, and what I am building toward.
