    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>
      I am an engineer by passion and an entrepreneur by profession.
      I enjoy building systems, products, and ideas from the ground up.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am currently a student while simultaneously working on my own ventures.
      I believe real learning happens by building, failing, and iterating —
      not by waiting for permission.
    </p>

    <p>
      I prefer working quietly and letting results speak.
      Attention does not interest me. Progress does.
